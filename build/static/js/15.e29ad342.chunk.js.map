It is controlled by a mysterious, humanoid entity formally known as SCP004-A, more colloqually known as Mr. Georgian Atlanta or The Landlord. Mr. Atlanta and his mysterious dimension were first officially documented in Atlanta in 1877, exactly 2 days after President Lincoln first signed the order for a silent organization dedicated to researching and containing anomalous objects and phenomena. He was discovered by field agents sent out to scout for an ideal headquarters, although stories of a mysterious man welcoming visitors into a home with an interior impossibly larger than its exterior were reported for up to a week before.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title = \"Containment\" message= \"SCP004 is contained in its own pocket dimension, where it serves as containment for all other contained SCPs.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"SCP004, Dimension A1\" message= {\"SCP004, also named Dimension A1 (the logical progression if the dimension of normals is A0), is a pocket dimension, meaning it is a segmented portion of reality enclosed in another larger reality (A0). It is rectangular in shape with an infinite amount of segmented sections extending infinitely downard called \\\"floors\\\". Each floor is further segmented into \\\"rooms\\\", much like a normal building. With the exception of the negative y-direction A1 is bounded in all other directions in 3 dimensional space. SCP004-A warns that reality is significantly more unreliable as floors increase; as a result, no individual below security clearance 5 is allowed past level 10 and no individual bar the Director and O5 council are allowed past level 30. A1's classification as Hazard C means it has been proven to be capable of supporting life as we know it, in contrast to Haz A, which is completely inhospitable; Haz B, where physics and laws of reality are close enough to support life but life has yet to be found; and Haz D, where reality is simply too different to make a conclusion. Its moldable quality means that it can be altered or changed; SCP004-A is the only one known to be able to mold SCP004. As with many pocket dimensions, entrance into A1 is trivial once an entrance has been found or created. These entrances are often the doorway of existing buildings that Mr. Atlanta designates. Mr. Atlanta is the only one known to be able to create entrances; he claims that he can also destroy them but they take considerably more time and effort. \"}/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"SCP004-A, Mr. Georgian Atlanta/The Landlord\" message={\"SCP004-A is an anomalous humanoid that resembles a middle-aged black man with white hair.
