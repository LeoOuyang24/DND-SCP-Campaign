However, researchers have been able to extract a black box that seems to be at the heart of SCP002's function. Implementation of ASCP001 requires the simple reprogramming of this black box to travel to physical coordinates. Although programming extradimensional coordinates is a completely unknown can of worms, programming for coordinates within the same dimension is much easier. How exactly this black box allows for constant time travel is still not fully understood, although the leading theory is that it borrows time from neighboring realities."})]}}}]);
