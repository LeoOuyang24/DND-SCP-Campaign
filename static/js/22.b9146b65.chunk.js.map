Kronaria most likely had access to magic and other anomalous technologies and was significantly more technologically advanced compared to its contemporaries. The strangest quality of Kronaria, and what truly classifies it as an SCP, is its complete disapparance sometime around 300 BCE. The city leaves no physical remains and the only suggestions of its existence are records from its neighbors from the time and occasional temporal distortions in various countries in the modern middle east.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title = \"Description\" message= \"Kronaria carefully guarded its magical secrets, allowing only a few visitors in at a time. The few records of Kronaria's existence comes from journal entries from these lucky visitors. Kronaria was described as surrounded by an opaque 'purple field' that detered all physical objects unless allowed by specific 'clerics'. Once inside, visitors described levitating structures, magic users casting spells, as well as potions and enchanted objects. Society was divided into castes, with magic users at the top holding various government and educational positions while slaves and nonsignificant farmers and commoners made up the bottom. The highest members of society were a secretive group known as The Order that were rarely seen in public. Nothing else is known about them.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"Disappearance\" message=\"Kronaria's disappearance was first noted by traveling traders sometime in 300 BCE. The city left no physical remains and its former location was soon taken over by surrounding civilizations hoping to finally figure out the root of Kronaria's sorcery only to find nothing. Since Kronaria's disappearance, temporal anomalies, labeled SCP010-A, have been observed continuing into the modern day. SCP010-A instances are temporal distortions where individuals in an area perceive time faster or slower than normal. 010-A instances vary considerably in scale and duration, with some affecting entire cities for hours, while others may only affect a small 1cm squared area. It's possible that an extreme instance of 010-A caused Kronaria to experience time so fast they experienced their own downfall in a matter of hours, causing its disappearance.\"/>\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t)\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
