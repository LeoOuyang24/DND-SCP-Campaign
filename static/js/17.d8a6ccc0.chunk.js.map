Calling themselves the Moonkin, SCP005 is the only other known species of sentient life on Earth that developed non-nomadic society.

They were capable of various forms of druidic magic, including shapeshifting and even minor fortune telling. They aged much slower than humans with lifespans exceeding 150 years, but they wouldn't come of age until their 30s.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"History\" message={\"Much of what we know about the Moonkin are from excavation of their ancient empire as well as from human records documenting their interactions with them. According to Moonkin texts, the Moonkin are descendants of the moon god,\\\"Arthos\\\", and that they are the parallel dimension counterparts to another species, the Sunkin who were descended from the sun god,\\\"Rathos\\\". More realistically, researchers believe that the Moonkin were most likely descended from a species of bird that diverged from the main lineage shortly after Baptisinia. Close proximity to the Baptisinian site over the millenia caused the Moonkin ancestors to integrate Baptisinia's magic into their biology. It is believed that Baptisinia probably caused the evolution of thousands of anomalous species, many of which are undetectable, or, most likely, evolved into a form incompatible with our reality. The Moonkin were most likely a unique case that was exposed to only light amounts of otherworldly energies (magic) such that they not only survived, but even used magic as an evolutionary benefit.\"}/>,\n\t\t\t<br/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.MessageSubSection message=\"The modern species of Moonkin evolved some 10,000 years ago, although staples of civilzation, such as agriculture and division of labor, were developed long before then. The Moonkin are not keen on migrating and as a result, sedentary civilization developed for the Moonkins long before humans. Another unusual aspect of the development of Moonkin was how united it began; in fact, it is unknown if the Moonkin history ever had any civilization that was not a single, unifying empire. The first empire, Yathmen (Kingdom of Rainbow), began at least as early as 11,000 years ago. Over the centuries, as the Moonkin refined their politics, they replaced many of their rulers and governing systems and changed their empire's name. Millenia later, the Olmecs wrote of owlfolk that lived in a kingdom of sky (suggesting that the modern name Bulithal (Skylands) had already been established). The Mayans would later report trading with owl-like creatures that would exchange berries that helped them communicate with the gods for various seemingly useless herbs. Some even entered the Moonkin's tutalege and became wizards. Years later, the conquistadors signed treaties with the Moonkin, which prevented either side from attacking the other.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<br/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.MessageSubSection message=\"For millenia, man and moonkin coexisted peacefully, even when man-man relations were running sour. By the 1600s, however, the Moonkin were annoyed by the expanding reach of human civilization. They were pressured into signing unfair treaties that left them with little land. Spanish colonies bolstered by Spanish forces ultimately drove the Moonkin back. Though the Spanish king cited territory as the principle reason, he had long viewed the Moonkin's magical powers as a challenge to his authority, as his own army was trained in the use of magic and he wished to keep magic a secret from the rest of the world. He ultimately drove the Moonkin empire to a small, isolated area that included the Chicxulub Crater, where the Moonkin remained until 1878.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<br/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.MessageSubSection message=\"Even before the Foundation, the Moonkin were kept secret by the local leaders of South America, who feared showing magic to the rest of the world (in reality, nearly all major governments had a source of magic they were also trying to hide from the rest of the world). When the Moonkin were driven out, all records of them were destroyed. By the time of the Foundation's establishment in 1877, only a handful of locals were ever aware of the Moonkin. These same locals would leak the information to vacatining agents in the summer of 1890, who reported back. The Moonkin refused to be contained, as they believed the Chicxulub Crater was their holy ground. They were exterminated by a team of field agents in 1891. To date, no surviving Moonkin has ever been found. \"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"Culture\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.SubSubSection title=\"Gods\" message=\"The Moonkin were bitheistic believers of a sun god and a moon god.
