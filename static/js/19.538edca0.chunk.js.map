They live in vast colonies sprawling countless dimensions and are more than capable of finding more and expanding further, like army ants over a jungle floor. How they create passageways to other dimensions is poorly studied as they are highly hostile. 90% of a colony is estimated to be general workers, who defend the colony, take care of young, and cultivate SCP009-A. When expanding to new dimensions, these workers can mutate into biological structures that form the segments that ultimately create a Kruthik Hill. Workers typically are assigned a role after 3 months of larval form and work the role until their death, which is typically 5 years. An unknown, smaller percentage consists of elite warriors that are heavily armored and capable of defending the colony against extradimensional threats. These warriors have been observed using a form of dimensional tunneling mechanism to teleport and rapidly access areas within the same dimension. Thankfully, they rarely appear outside of emergencies. The final caste of known Kruthiks, outside of harmless larvae, is the queen. To date, no queen has been observed and it is unknown if there is one or multiple queens in a single colony.\"/>,\n\t\t\t<br/>,\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tThe instance stored within Dimension A1 is also the only instance of SCP009 stored by the Foundation and the only known colony that possesses any threat to A0 but discoveries in other realities hint that SCP009 is an entire race of beings that plague most realities similar to A0 in biology, rather than a single anomalous colony.</div>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title =\"Containment\" message=\"Containment of 009 is stored in Floor 1-KR, more colloquially known as the Ant Farm to employees. The Ant Farm is a pocket dimension that is linked to an unknown number of other pocket dimensions. Entrance to the Ant Farm is a single steel gate that is to be unopenable except by Class 3 security clearance. The gate is to be monitored 24/7 by no less than 10 class 3 soldiers. Every 5 years, protocol Pilgramage must be invoked to link the Ant Farm to a newly generated pocket dimension. Mr. Georgian Atlanta will handle the dimension creation logistics. \"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"Kruthik Hill Structure\" message=\"Kruthik hills are the name given to the physical structures that Kruthiks nest in. These structures are composed of networks of heavily mutated Kruthik workers that have an interior and exterior. Think like hollow Lego blocks. The interior section is notably dark and houses many Kruthik larvae, all of which are heavily guarded. It is believed that the hivelord as well as a hypothetical hivelord caretaker caste of Kruthiks nest here although neither have ever been observed directly. Food is also stored in designated chambers underground. The exterior is capable of producing light that SCP009-A readily absorbs. It is here that workers cultivate SCP009-A as well as leave waste, which is believed to fertilize SCP009-A\" />,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"SCP009-A\" message=\"More colloquially known as Kruth Trees, 009-A is massive tree-like organism that grows exclusively on the exteriors of Kruthik Hills. It expands on large-branch like structures that produce a soft, fluffy pink outer layer. These fuzzy 'leaves' cushion the branches from the sharp blades that are Kruthik legs. 009-A produced SCP009-B, a green, honey-like chemical simply called Juice by researchers. Juice grows out of 009-A in crystal-like structures that instantly become liquid upon contact with any physical surface. The only exception to this is SCP009-A and SCP009 workers. Despite their powerful jaws and hostility, Kruthiks are not carnivores and feed exclusively on Juice. When consumed by humans, as well as most organisms on A0, Juice causes massive memory loss. It is key to the development of Foundation amnestics and is harvested on  monthly basis. \"/>,\n\t\t\t<br/>,\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tNote: It appears that there is a slight biological difference between workers that regularly work on the interior of hills and those that work on the exterior.
