They quickly exploded in popularity and many hotels after were modeled after them. While they offered many of the same features as other hotels, such as a team of trained housekeepers and award-winning shows, the hotels were most frequently praised for their atmosphere, which patrons described as nostalgic, lonely, euphoric, and melancholy. Many patrons would often return to the hotels, claiming that they couldn't stop dreaming about them. SCP006 is an infovorous entity that at some point began feasting on these dreams and as a result has taken the form of these hotels. A mass amnestic program was administered in 2001 and all SS Retreats were closed down. However, the hotels' memorable appearance and atmosphere, not to mention the its global impact on hotel design, has allowed SCP006 to persist in the human memory. Victims have often described feeling as if hotels feel off, even otherwordly. Severe victims have their memories completely consumed and are renderd an empty husk. SCP006 is most easily accessible through dreams, as that is its favorite food to consume. Once a target is found, SCP006 will attempt to lure the victim to sleep in the victim's dream. This allows SCP006 full access to the victim's brain and info. Survivors have described being lured to sleep by a team of highly trained and smooth-talking androids, faceless humanoid entities that have a speaker for a mouth (SCP006-A).\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.Section title=\"SCP006-A\" message=\"\"/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.ImageSubSection image = {pic} caption=\"Instance of SCP006-A, at reception\" style={{width:\"20%\"}}/>,\n\t\t\t<br/>,\n\t\t\t<Formats.MessageSubSection message = {\"The caretakers within SCP006 are faceless humanoids that resemble androids or modeling dummies.
