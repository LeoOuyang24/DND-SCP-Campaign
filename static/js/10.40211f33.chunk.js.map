All is known is that when hung at least 3 feet above a sleeping person, the person can establish links with other sleeping people under dream catchers. Magical humans have been shown to be able to manipulate these dream channels to allow only secure communication only with specific individuals. This causes dream communication to be one of the most secure forms of communication with the slight downside of requiring sleep.\"/>] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t)\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
