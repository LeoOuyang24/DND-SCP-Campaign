Reality Bound Grenades, or RBGs, show how they can be weaponized and used to contain or at least inhibit SCPs. When thrown, the grenades create a 15 foot radius field of stabilized reality. This is enough to suppress most minor SCPs as well as shut down the magical abilities of any anomolous humans."/>]
