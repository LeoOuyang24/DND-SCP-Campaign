			intro="ASCP004 is an ebony statue modeled after the real organism Drosophila melanogaster. The ebony it is constructed from is dated to around the 12th century and was recovered from an unmarked tomb in Indonesia. When attuned to an individual, the individual can at will cause the statue to enlarge in size to that of a giant fly, which obeys the individual's every command. The fly reverts to a dormant statue after 12 hours or when destroyed and can only be used again after 48 hours."/>]
