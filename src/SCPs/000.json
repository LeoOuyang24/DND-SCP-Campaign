The name is in reference to the Baptistina family of asteroids, which paelontologists once believed to be the origin of what they believed was a meteorite that caused the K-T mass extinction.",

				"message": "Despite being one of the most fundamental SCPs, very little is known about Baptistina. All is known is that 65 million years ago, an anomalous event occured that significantly destabilized reality. From a scientific perspective, this caused a mass extinction, wiping out the non-avian dinosaurs and many other specieis. From a parascientific perspective, Baptistina disturbed the fabric of reality, causing adjacent realities to seap through. Though SCPs almost certainly happened on Earth and around the universe before Baptistina, they were extremely rare with maybe one occurring every couple million years, whereas now there are hundreds of known SCPs, at least 90% of which came into existence within the last 10,000 years."
