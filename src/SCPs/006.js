Though its physical presense was exterminated long ago, it continues to exist in human thought and memory."/>,
			<Formats.Section title ="Containment" message={"SCP006 impacts a large portion of the world population and the sheer amount of information it has consumed makes it difficult to contain. Anyone that remembers or mentions the Shining Stars Retreat are to be immediately administered amnestics, as well as all their closest relatives and friends. The only exception are employees of the Foundation working directly on SCP006 containment."}/>,
			<Formats.Section title = "Description" message= "In the late 1990s, a string of hotels called the Shining Stars Retreat sprung up. They quickly exploded in popularity and many hotels after were modeled after them. While they offered many of the same features as other hotels, such as a team of trained housekeepers and award-winning shows, the hotels were most frequently praised for their atmosphere, which patrons described as nostalgic, lonely, euphoric, and melancholy. Many patrons would often return to the hotels, claiming that they couldn't stop dreaming about them. SCP006 is an infovorous entity that at some point began feasting on these dreams and as a result has taken the form of these hotels. A mass amnestic program was administered in 2001 and all SS Retreats were closed down. However, the hotels' memorable appearance and atmosphere, not to mention the its global impact on hotel design, has allowed SCP006 to persist in the human memory. Victims have often described feeling as if hotels feel off, even otherwordly. Severe victims have their memories completely consumed and are renderd an empty husk. SCP006 is most easily accessible through dreams, as that is its favorite food to consume. Once a target is found, SCP006 will attempt to lure the victim to sleep in the victim's dream. This allows SCP006 full access to the victim's brain and info. Survivors have described being lured to sleep by a team of highly trained and smooth-talking androids, faceless humanoid entities that have a speaker for a mouth (SCP006-A)."/>,

			<Formats.MessageSubSection message = {"The caretakers within SCP006 are faceless humanoids that resemble androids or modeling dummies. They are covered in a white substance resembling plastic, but much harder, and wear formal human attire, such as suit and tie and dresses. Their only orrifice is a circular collection of dots, resembling that of a speaker. Unlike most SCPs, which are only capable of communicating in Universal, SCP006-A is able to speak perfectly understandable human speech, in any human language. Individuals will claim that they want to \"ensure the best possible experience for all guests\" and will attempt to relax guests before suggesting they take a nap. Field agents have reported increased agitation and aggression the longer it takes for a subject to comply."}/>]
